# Topology-Optimization-Code

## Requirements
Matlab 2015b or newer. Older versions may be sufficient but have not been tested.
Reticolo - rigourous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) solver. Can be downloaded from [RETICOLO](https://www.lp2n.institutoptique.fr/Membres-Services/Responsables-d-equipe/LALANNE-Philippe). Copy the folder `reticolo_allege` into the working directory.

## Quick start
Run `RunOpt.m` with default parameters. The example optimization should begin immediately if all files have been installed corrected.

In `RunOpt.m`, define all optimization parameters as necessary. Descriptions of all parameters can be found in `Functions/Initialize.m` along with their default values.

A schematic of metagrating operation can be found at [MetaNet](http://metanet.stanford.edu/search/dielectric-metagratings/info/).
